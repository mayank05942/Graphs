<b> What is Graph:</b>

<pre> Graphs are the perfect data structure for modeling networks, which make them an indispensable piece of your data structure toolkit. 
Theyâ€™re composed of nodes, or vertices, which hold data, and edges, which are a connection between two vertices.
A single node is a vertex.

Consider a map of the area where you live. As a graph, we could model bus stops as vertices, with bus routes between stops
functioning as the edges.

What about the internet? Web pages can be vertices, and the hyperlinks which connect them are edges.

Real-world relationships modeled as graphs are numerous, making them an essential concept to master. </pre>

<b> To Connect, or Not to Connect? </b>

<pre> Graphs have varying degrees of connection. The higher the ratio of edges to vertices, the more connected the graph.

This graph represents a social network; people are vertices and edges are friendships. Ted is adjacent to Patty, Ron, and Alice 
because an edge directly connects them.

We use a single line for an edge, but these friendships are bi-directional. Patty is friends with Ron and Ron is friends with Patty.

A path is vertices which are connected by any number of intermediate edges. The paths from Alice to Patty could go Alice to Ted to Patty or, Alice to Ted to Ron to Patty.

No path exists between Sally and Ted. When no path exists between two vertices, a graph is disconnected. </pre>
