## Topological sort

Course schedule prob

DAG -> Directed and Acyclc graph

if a graph is directed and there is a cycle then Topological sort is not applicable there

need an Acyclic graph

Input is in the form of -> graph and the output is an array

requires a stack

idea is -> start from a node do DFS if from that node no other

node can be traversed append it to the stack
